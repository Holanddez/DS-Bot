# DS-Bot
Discord bot made with nextcord

# About 
This is a bot that I'm making to learn nextcord/discord.py. Also, I'm refactoring an old bot code
that I wrote.
<br>
Im not using slash commands mainly because I don't like it so much, perhaps I will add it.
<br>
It still under development, so it's missing some features
